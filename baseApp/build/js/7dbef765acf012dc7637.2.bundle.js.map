The purpose of `$animateCss` is NOT\n\t * to side-step how `$animate` and ngAnimate work, but the goal is to allow pre-existing animations or\n\t * directives to create more complex animations that can be purely driven using CSS code.\n\t *\n\t * Note that only browsers that support CSS transitions and/or keyframe animations are capable of\n\t * rendering animations triggered via `$animateCss` (bad news for IE9 and lower).\n\t *\n\t * ## Usage\n\t * Once again, `$animateCss` is designed to be used inside of a registered JavaScript animation that\n\t * is powered by ngAnimate. It is possible to use `$animateCss` directly inside of a directive, however,\n\t * any automatic control over cancelling animations and/or preventing animations from being run on\n\t * child elements will not be handled by Angular. For this to work as expected, please use `$animate` to\n\t * trigger the animation and then setup a JavaScript animation that injects `$animateCss` to trigger\n\t * the CSS animation.\n\t *\n\t * The example below shows how we can create a folding animation on an element using `ng-if`:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <!-- notice the `fold-animation` CSS class -->\n\t * <div ng-if=\"onOff\" class=\"fold-animation\">\n\t *   This element will go BOOM\n\t * </div>\n\t * <button ng-click=\"onOff=true\">Fold In</button>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Now we create the **JavaScript animation** that will trigger the CSS transition:\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * ngModule.animation('.fold-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {\n\t *   return {\n\t *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {\n\t *       var height = element[0].offsetHeight;\n\t *       return $animateCss(element, {\n\t *         from: { height:'0px' },\n\t *         to: { height:height + 'px' },\n\t *         duration: 1 // one second\n\t *       });\n\t *     }\n\t *   }\n\t * }]);\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * ## More Advanced Uses\n\t *\n\t * `$animateCss` is the underlying code that ngAnimate uses to power **CSS-based animations** behind the scenes. Therefore CSS hooks\n\t * like `.ng-EVENT`, `.ng-EVENT-active`, `.ng-EVENT-stagger` are all features that can be triggered using `$animateCss` via JavaScript code.\n\t *\n\t * This also means that just about any combination of adding classes, removing classes, setting styles, dynamically setting a keyframe animation,\n\t * applying a hardcoded duration or delay value, changing the animation easing or applying a stagger animation are all options that work with\n\t * `$animateCss`. The service itself is smart enough to figure out the combination of options and examine the element styling properties in order\n\t * to provide a working animation that will run in CSS.\n\t *\n\t * The example below showcases a more advanced version of the `.fold-animation` from the example above:\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * ngModule.animation('.fold-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {\n\t *   return {\n\t *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {\n\t *       var height = element[0].offsetHeight;\n\t *       return $animateCss(element, {\n\t *         addClass: 'red large-text pulse-twice',\n\t *         easing: 'ease-out',\n\t *         from: { height:'0px' },\n\t *         to: { height:height + 'px' },\n\t *         duration: 1 // one second\n\t *       });\n\t *     }\n\t *   }\n\t * }]);\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Since we're adding/removing CSS classes then the CSS transition will also pick those up:\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * /&#42; since a hardcoded duration value of 1 was provided in the JavaScript animation code,\n\t * the CSS classes below will be transitioned despite them being defined as regular CSS classes &#42;/\n\t * .red { background:red; }\n\t * .large-text { font-size:20px; }\n\t *\n\t * /&#42; we can also use a keyframe animation and $animateCss will make it work alongside the transition &#42;/\n\t * .pulse-twice {\n\t *   animation: 0.5s pulse linear 2;\n\t *   -webkit-animation: 0.5s pulse linear 2;\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * @keyframes pulse {\n\t *   from { transform: scale(0.5); }\n\t *   to { transform: scale(1.5); }\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * @-webkit-keyframes pulse {\n\t *   from { -webkit-transform: scale(0.5); }\n\t *   to { -webkit-transform: scale(1.5); }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Given this complex combination of CSS classes, styles and options, `$animateCss` will figure everything out and make the animation happen.\n\t *\n\t * ## How the Options are handled\n\t *\n\t * `$animateCss` is very versatile and intelligent when it comes to figuring out what configurations to apply to the element to ensure the animation\n\t * works with the options provided. Say for example we were adding a class that contained a keyframe value and we wanted to also animate some inline\n\t * styles using the `from` and `to` properties.\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * var animator = $animateCss(element, {\n\t *   from: { background:'red' },\n\t *   to: { background:'blue' }\n\t * });\n\t * animator.start();\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * .rotating-animation {\n\t *   animation:0.5s rotate linear;\n\t *   -webkit-animation:0.5s rotate linear;\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * @keyframes rotate {\n\t *   from { transform: rotate(0deg); }\n\t *   to { transform: rotate(360deg); }\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * @-webkit-keyframes rotate {\n\t *   from { -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg); }\n\t *   to { -webkit-transform: rotate(360deg); }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * The missing pieces here are that we do not have a transition set (within the CSS code nor within the `$animateCss` options) and the duration of the animation is\n\t * going to be detected from what the keyframe styles on the CSS class are. In this event, `$animateCss` will automatically create an inline transition\n\t * style matching the duration detected from the keyframe style (which is present in the CSS class that is being added) and then prepare both the transition\n\t * and keyframe animations to run in parallel on the element. Then when the animation is underway the provided `from` and `to` CSS styles will be applied\n\t * and spread across the transition and keyframe animation.\n\t *\n\t * ## What is returned\n\t *\n\t * `$animateCss` works in two stages: a preparation phase and an animation phase. Therefore when `$animateCss` is first called it will NOT actually\n\t * start the animation. All that is going on here is that the element is being prepared for the animation (which means that the generated CSS classes are\n\t * added and removed on the element). Once `$animateCss` is called it will return an object with the following properties:\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * var animator = $animateCss(element, { ... });\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Now what do the contents of our `animator` variable look like:\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * {\n\t *   // starts the animation\n\t *   start: Function,\n\t *\n\t *   // ends (aborts) the animation\n\t *   end: Function\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * To actually start the animation we need to run `animation.start()` which will then return a promise that we can hook into to detect when the animation ends.\n\t * If we choose not to run the animation then we MUST run `animation.end()` to perform a cleanup on the element (since some CSS classes and stlyes may have been\n\t * applied to the element during the preparation phase). Note that all other properties such as duration, delay, transitions and keyframes are just properties\n\t * and that changing them will not reconfigure the parameters of the animation.\n\t *\n\t * ### runner.done() vs runner.then()\n\t * It is documented that `animation.start()` will return a promise object and this is true, however, there is also an additional method available on the\n\t * runner called `.done(callbackFn)`. The done method works the same as `.finally(callbackFn)`, however, it does **not trigger a digest to occur**.\n\t * Therefore, for performance reasons, it's always best to use `runner.done(callback)` instead of `runner.then()`, `runner.catch()` or `runner.finally()`\n\t * unless you really need a digest to kick off afterwards.\n\t *\n\t * Keep in mind that, to make this easier, ngAnimate has tweaked the JS animations API to recognize when a runner instance is returned from $animateCss\n\t * (so there is no need to call `runner.done(doneFn)` inside of your JavaScript animation code).\n\t * Check the {@link ngAnimate.$animateCss#usage animation code above} to see how this works.\n\t *\n\t * @param {DOMElement} element the element that will be animated\n\t * @param {object} options the animation-related options that will be applied during the animation\n\t *\n\t * * `event` - The DOM event (e.g. enter, leave, move). When used, a generated CSS class of `ng-EVENT` and `ng-EVENT-active` will be applied\n\t * to the element during the animation. Multiple events can be provided when spaces are used as a separator. (Note that this will not perform any DOM operation.)\n\t * * `structural` - Indicates that the `ng-` prefix will be added to the event class. Setting to `false` or omitting will turn `ng-EVENT` and\n\t * `ng-EVENT-active` in `EVENT` and `EVENT-active`. Unused if `event` is omitted.\n\t * * `easing` - The CSS easing value that will be applied to the transition or keyframe animation (or both).\n\t * * `transitionStyle` - The raw CSS transition style that will be used (e.g. `1s linear all`).\n\t * * `keyframeStyle` - The raw CSS keyframe animation style that will be used (e.g. `1s my_animation linear`).\n\t * * `from` - The starting CSS styles (a key/value object) that will be applied at the start of the animation.\n\t * * `to` - The ending CSS styles (a key/value object) that will be applied across the animation via a CSS transition.\n\t * * `addClass` - A space separated list of CSS classes that will be added to the element and spread across the animation.\n\t * * `removeClass` - A space separated list of CSS classes that will be removed from the element and spread across the animation.\n\t * * `duration` - A number value representing the total duration of the transition and/or keyframe (note that a value of 1 is 1000ms). If a value of `0`\n\t * is provided then the animation will be skipped entirely.\n\t * * `delay` - A number value representing the total delay of the transition and/or keyframe (note that a value of 1 is 1000ms). If a value of `true` is\n\t * used then whatever delay value is detected from the CSS classes will be mirrored on the elements styles (e.g. by setting delay true then the style value\n\t * of the element will be `transition-delay: DETECTED_VALUE`). Using `true` is useful when you want the CSS classes and inline styles to all share the same\n\t * CSS delay value.\n\t * * `stagger` - A numeric time value representing the delay between successively animated elements\n\t * ({@link ngAnimate#css-staggering-animations Click here to learn how CSS-based staggering works in ngAnimate.})\n\t * * `staggerIndex` - The numeric index representing the stagger item (e.g. a value of 5 is equal to the sixth item in the stagger; therefore when a\n\t * * `stagger` option value of `0.1` is used then there will be a stagger delay of `600ms`)\n\t * * `applyClassesEarly` - Whether or not the classes being added or removed will be used when detecting the animation. This is set by `$animate` when enter/leave/move animations are fired to ensure that the CSS classes are resolved in time. (Note that this will prevent any transitions from occuring on the classes being added and removed.)\n\t * * `cleanupStyles` - Whether or not the provided `from` and `to` styles will be removed once\n\t *    the animation is closed. This is useful for when the styles are used purely for the sake of\n\t *    the animation and do not have a lasting visual effect on the element (e.g. a colapse and open animation).\n\t *    By default this value is set to `false`.\n\t *\n\t * @return {object} an object with start and end methods and details about the animation.\n\t *\n\t * * `start` - The method to start the animation. This will return a `Promise` when called.\n\t * * `end` - This method will cancel the animation and remove all applied CSS classes and styles.\n\t */\n\tvar ONE_SECOND = 1000;\n\tvar BASE_TEN = 10;\n\t\n\tvar ELAPSED_TIME_MAX_DECIMAL_PLACES = 3;\n\tvar CLOSING_TIME_BUFFER = 1.5;\n\t\n\tvar DETECT_CSS_PROPERTIES = {\n\t  transitionDuration:      TRANSITION_DURATION_PROP,\n\t  transitionDelay:         TRANSITION_DELAY_PROP,\n\t  transitionProperty:      TRANSITION_PROP + PROPERTY_KEY,\n\t  animationDuration:       ANIMATION_DURATION_PROP,\n\t  animationDelay:          ANIMATION_DELAY_PROP,\n\t  animationIterationCount: ANIMATION_PROP + ANIMATION_ITERATION_COUNT_KEY\n\t};\n\t\n\tvar DETECT_STAGGER_CSS_PROPERTIES = {\n\t  transitionDuration:      TRANSITION_DURATION_PROP,\n\t  transitionDelay:         TRANSITION_DELAY_PROP,\n\t  animationDuration:       ANIMATION_DURATION_PROP,\n\t  animationDelay:          ANIMATION_DELAY_PROP\n\t};\n\t\n\tfunction getCssKeyframeDurationStyle(duration) {\n\t  return [ANIMATION_DURATION_PROP, duration + 's'];\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction getCssDelayStyle(delay, isKeyframeAnimation) {\n\t  var prop = isKeyframeAnimation ?

Animations are not enabled by default, however, by including `ngAnimate` the animation hooks are enabled for an Angular app.\n\t *\n\t * <div doc-module-components=\"ngAnimate\"></div>\n\t *\n\t * # Usage\n\t * Simply put, there are two ways to make use of animations when ngAnimate is used: by using **CSS** and **JavaScript**. The former works purely based\n\t * using CSS (by using matching CSS selectors/styles) and the latter triggers animations that are registered via `module.animation()`. For\n\t * both CSS and JS animations the sole requirement is to have a matching `CSS class` that exists both in the registered animation and within\n\t * the HTML element that the animation will be triggered on.\n\t *\n\t * ## Directive Support\n\t * The following directives are \"animation aware\":\n\t *\n\t * | Directive                                                                                                | Supported Animations                                                     |\n\t * |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\t * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#animations ngRepeat}                                                        | enter, leave and move                                                    |\n\t * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#animations ngView}                                                       | enter and leave                                                          |\n\t * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#animations ngInclude}                                                      | enter and leave                                                          |\n\t * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#animations ngSwitch}                                                        | enter and leave                                                          |\n\t * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#animations ngIf}                                                                | enter and leave                                                          |\n\t * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#animations ngClass}                                                          | add and remove (the CSS class(es) present)                               |\n\t * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#animations ngShow} & {@link ng.directive:ngHide#animations ngHide}            | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)                                 |\n\t * | {@link ng.directive:form#animation-hooks form} & {@link ng.directive:ngModel#animation-hooks ngModel}    | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations) |\n\t * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessages}                                                          | add and remove (ng-active & ng-inactive)                                 |\n\t * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessage}                                                           | enter and leave                                                          |\n\t *\n\t * (More information can be found by visiting each the documentation associated with each directive.)\n\t *\n\t * ## CSS-based Animations\n\t *\n\t * CSS-based animations with ngAnimate are unique since they require no JavaScript code at all. By using a CSS class that we reference between our HTML\n\t * and CSS code we can create an animation that will be picked up by Angular when an the underlying directive performs an operation.\n\t *\n\t * The example below shows how an `enter` animation can be made possible on an element using `ng-if`:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <div ng-if=\"bool\" class=\"fade\">\n\t *    Fade me in out\n\t * </div>\n\t * <button ng-click=\"bool=true\">Fade In!</button>\n\t * <button ng-click=\"bool=false\">Fade Out!</button>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Notice the CSS class **fade**? We can now create the CSS transition code that references this class:\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * /&#42; The starting CSS styles for the enter animation &#42;/\n\t * .fade.ng-enter {\n\t *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n\t *   opacity:0;\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * /&#42; The finishing CSS styles for the enter animation &#42;/\n\t * .fade.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n\t *   opacity:1;\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * The key thing to remember here is that, depending on the animation event (which each of the directives above trigger depending on what's going on) two\n\t * generated CSS classes will be applied to the element; in the example above we have `.ng-enter` and `.ng-enter-active`. For CSS transitions, the transition\n\t * code **must** be defined within the starting CSS class (in this case `.ng-enter`). The destination class is what the transition will animate towards.\n\t *\n\t * If for example we wanted to create animations for `leave` and `move` (ngRepeat triggers move) then we can do so using the same CSS naming conventions:\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * /&#42; now the element will fade out before it is removed from the DOM &#42;/\n\t * .fade.ng-leave {\n\t *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n\t *   opacity:1;\n\t * }\n\t * .fade.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {\n\t *   opacity:0;\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * We can also make use of **CSS Keyframes** by referencing the keyframe animation within the starting CSS class:\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * /&#42; there is no need to define anything inside of the destination\n\t * CSS class since the keyframe will take charge of the animation &#42;/\n\t * .fade.ng-leave {\n\t *   animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;\n\t *   -webkit-animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * @keyframes my_fade_animation {\n\t *   from { opacity:1; }\n\t *   to { opacity:0; }\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * @-webkit-keyframes my_fade_animation {\n\t *   from { opacity:1; }\n\t *   to { opacity:0; }\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Feel free also mix transitions and keyframes together as well as any other CSS classes on the same element.\n\t *\n\t * ### CSS Class-based Animations\n\t *\n\t * Class-based animations (animations that are triggered via `ngClass`, `ngShow`, `ngHide` and some other directives) have a slightly different\n\t * naming convention. Class-based animations are basic enough that a standard transition or keyframe can be referenced on the class being added\n\t * and removed.\n\t *\n\t * For example if we wanted to do a CSS animation for `ngHide` then we place an animation on the `.ng-hide` CSS class:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <div ng-show=\"bool\" class=\"fade\">\n\t *   Show and hide me\n\t * </div>\n\t * <button ng-click=\"bool=true\">Toggle</button>\n\t *\n\t * <style>\n\t * .fade.ng-hide {\n\t *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n\t *   opacity:0;\n\t * }\n\t * </style>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * All that is going on here with ngShow/ngHide behind the scenes is the `.ng-hide` class is added/removed (when the hidden state is valid). Since\n\t * ngShow and ngHide are animation aware then we can match up a transition and ngAnimate handles the rest.\n\t *\n\t * In addition the addition and removal of the CSS class, ngAnimate also provides two helper methods that we can use to further decorate the animation\n\t * with CSS styles.\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <div ng-class=\"{on:onOff}\" class=\"highlight\">\n\t *   Highlight this box\n\t * </div>\n\t * <button ng-click=\"onOff=!onOff\">Toggle</button>\n\t *\n\t * <style>\n\t * .highlight {\n\t *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n\t * }\n\t * .highlight.on-add {\n\t *   background:white;\n\t * }\n\t * .highlight.on {\n\t *   background:yellow;\n\t * }\n\t * .highlight.on-remove {\n\t *   background:black;\n\t * }\n\t * </style>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * We can also make use of CSS keyframes by placing them within the CSS classes.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ### CSS Staggering Animations\n\t * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a\n\t * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module (versions >=1.2) supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be\n\t * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for\n\t * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an\n\t * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * .my-animation.ng-enter {\n\t *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/\n\t *   transition: 1s linear all;\n\t *   opacity:0;\n\t * }\n\t * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {\n\t *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/\n\t *   transition-delay: 0.1s;\n\t *\n\t *   /&#42; As of 1.4.4, this must always be set: it signals ngAnimate\n\t *     to not accidentally inherit a delay property from another CSS class &#42;/\n\t *   transition-duration: 0s;\n\t * }\n\t * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n\t *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/\n\t *   opacity:1;\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations\n\t * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this\n\t * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation\n\t * will also be reset if one or more animation frames have passed since the multiple calls to `$animate` were fired.\n\t *\n\t * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * var kids = parent.children();\n\t *\n\t * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0\n\t * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1\n\t * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2\n\t * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3\n\t * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4\n\t *\n\t * window.requestAnimationFrame(function() {\n\t *   //stagger has reset itself\n\t *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0\n\t *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1\n\t *\n\t *   $scope.$digest();\n\t * });\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.\n\t *\n\t * ### The `ng-animate` CSS class\n\t *\n\t * When ngAnimate is animating an element it will apply the `ng-animate` CSS class to the element for the duration of the animation.\n\t * This is a temporary CSS class and it will be removed once the animation is over (for both JavaScript and CSS-based animations).\n\t *\n\t * Therefore, animations can be applied to an element using this temporary class directly via CSS.\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * .zipper.ng-animate {\n\t *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n\t * }\n\t * .zipper.ng-enter {\n\t *   opacity:0;\n\t * }\n\t * .zipper.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n\t *   opacity:1;\n\t * }\n\t * .zipper.ng-leave {\n\t *   opacity:1;\n\t * }\n\t * .zipper.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {\n\t *   opacity:0;\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * (Note that the `ng-animate` CSS class is reserved and it cannot be applied on an element directly since ngAnimate will always remove\n\t * the CSS class once an animation has completed.)\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ## JavaScript-based Animations\n\t *\n\t * ngAnimate also allows for animations to be consumed by JavaScript code. The approach is similar to CSS-based animations (where there is a shared\n\t * CSS class that is referenced in our HTML code) but in addition we need to register the JavaScript animation on the module. By making use of the\n\t * `module.animation()` module function we can register the ainmation.\n\t *\n\t * Let's see an example of a enter/leave animation using `ngRepeat`:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <div ng-repeat=\"item in items\" class=\"slide\">\n\t *   {{ item }}\n\t * </div>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * See the **slide** CSS class? Let's use that class to define an animation that we'll structure in our module code by using `module.animation`:\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * myModule.animation('.slide', [function() {\n\t *   return {\n\t *     // make note that other events (like addClass/removeClass)\n\t *     // have different function input parameters\n\t *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {\n\t *       jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);\n\t *\n\t *       // remember to call doneFn so that angular\n\t *       // knows that the animation has concluded\n\t *     },\n\t *\n\t *     move: function(element, doneFn) {\n\t *       jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);\n\t *     },\n\t *\n\t *     leave: function(element, doneFn) {\n\t *       jQuery(element).fadeOut(1000, doneFn);\n\t *     }\n\t *   }\n\t * }]);\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * The nice thing about JS-based animations is that we can inject other services and make use of advanced animation libraries such as\n\t * greensock.js and velocity.js.\n\t *\n\t * If our animation code class-based (meaning that something like `ngClass`, `ngHide` and `ngShow` triggers it) then we can still define\n\t * our animations inside of the same registered animation, however, the function input arguments are a bit different:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <div ng-class=\"color\" class=\"colorful\">\n\t *   this box is moody\n\t * </div>\n\t * <button ng-click=\"color='red'\">Change to red</button>\n\t * <button ng-click=\"color='blue'\">Change to blue</button>\n\t * <button ng-click=\"color='green'\">Change to green</button>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * myModule.animation('.colorful', [function() {\n\t *   return {\n\t *     addClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {\n\t *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn\n\t *     },\n\t *     removeClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {\n\t *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn\n\t *     },\n\t *     setClass: function(element, addedClass, removedClass, doneFn) {\n\t *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn\n\t *     }\n\t *   }\n\t * }]);\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * ## CSS + JS Animations Together\n\t *\n\t * AngularJS 1.4 and higher has taken steps to make the amalgamation of CSS and JS animations more flexible. However, unlike earlier versions of Angular,\n\t * defining CSS and JS animations to work off of the same CSS class will not work anymore. Therefore the example below will only result in **JS animations taking\n\t * charge of the animation**:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <div ng-if=\"bool\" class=\"slide\">\n\t *   Slide in and out\n\t * </div>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * myModule.animation('.slide', [function() {\n\t *   return {\n\t *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {\n\t *       jQuery(element).slideIn(1000, doneFn);\n\t *     }\n\t *   }\n\t * }]);\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * .slide.ng-enter {\n\t *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n\t *   transform:translateY(-100px);\n\t * }\n\t * .slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n\t *   transform:translateY(0);\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Does this mean that CSS and JS animations cannot be used together? Do JS-based animations always have higher priority? We can make up for the\n\t * lack of CSS animations by using the `$animateCss` service to trigger our own tweaked-out, CSS-based animations directly from\n\t * our own JS-based animation code:\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * myModule.animation('.slide', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {\n\t *   return {\n\t *     enter: function(element) {\n\t*        // this will trigger `.slide.ng-enter` and `.slide.ng-enter-active`.\n\t *       return $animateCss(element, {\n\t *         event: 'enter',\n\t *         structural: true\n\t *       });\n\t *     }\n\t *   }\n\t * }]);\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * The nice thing here is that we can save bandwidth by sticking to our CSS-based animation code and we don't need to rely on a 3rd-party animation framework.\n\t *\n\t * The `$animateCss` service is very powerful since we can feed in all kinds of extra properties that will be evaluated and fed into a CSS transition or\n\t * keyframe animation. For example if we wanted to animate the height of an element while adding and removing classes then we can do so by providing that\n\t * data into `$animateCss` directly:\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * myModule.animation('.slide', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {\n\t *   return {\n\t *     enter: function(element) {\n\t *       return $animateCss(element, {\n\t *         event: 'enter',\n\t *         structural: true,\n\t *         addClass: 'maroon-setting',\n\t *         from: { height:0 },\n\t *         to: { height: 200 }\n\t *       });\n\t *     }\n\t *   }\n\t * }]);\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Now we can fill in the rest via our transition CSS code:\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * /&#42; the transition tells ngAnimate to make the animation happen &#42;/\n\t * .slide.ng-enter { transition:0.5s linear all; }\n\t *\n\t * /&#42; this extra CSS class will be absorbed into the transition\n\t * since the $animateCss code is adding the class &#42;/\n\t * .maroon-setting { background:red; }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * And `$animateCss` will figure out the rest. Just make sure to have the `done()` callback fire the `doneFn` function to signal when the animation is over.\n\t *\n\t * To learn more about what's possible be sure to visit the {@link ngAnimate.$animateCss $animateCss service}.\n\t *\n\t * ## Animation Anchoring (via `ng-animate-ref`)\n\t *\n\t * ngAnimate in AngularJS 1.4 comes packed with the ability to cross-animate elements between\n\t * structural areas of an application (like views) by pairing up elements using an attribute\n\t * called `ng-animate-ref`.\n\t *\n\t * Let's say for example we have two views that are managed by `ng-view` and we want to show\n\t * that there is a relationship between two components situated in within these views. By using the\n\t * `ng-animate-ref` attribute we can identify that the two components are paired together and we\n\t * can then attach an animation, which is triggered when the view changes.\n\t *\n\t * Say for example we have the following template code:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <!-- index.html -->\n\t * <div ng-view class=\"view-animation\">\n\t * </div>\n\t *\n\t * <!-- home.html -->\n\t * <a href=\"#/banner-page\">\n\t *   <img src=\"./banner.jpg\" class=\"banner\" ng-animate-ref=\"banner\">\n\t * </a>\n\t *\n\t * <!-- banner-page.html -->\n\t * <img src=\"./banner.jpg\" class=\"banner\" ng-animate-ref=\"banner\">\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Now, when the view changes (once the link is clicked), ngAnimate will examine the\n\t * HTML contents to see if there is a match reference between any components in the view\n\t * that is leaving and the view that is entering. It will scan both the view which is being\n\t * removed (leave) and inserted (enter) to see if there are any paired DOM elements that\n\t * contain a matching ref value.\n\t *\n\t * The two images match since they share the same ref value. ngAnimate will now create a\n\t * transport element (which is a clone of the first image element) and it will then attempt\n\t * to animate to the position of the second image element in the next view. For the animation to\n\t * work a special CSS class called `ng-anchor` will be added to the transported element.\n\t *\n\t * We can now attach a transition onto the `.banner.ng-anchor` CSS class and then\n\t * ngAnimate will handle the entire transition for us as well as the addition and removal of\n\t * any changes of CSS classes between the elements:\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * .banner.ng-anchor {\n\t *   /&#42; this animation will last for 1 second since there are\n\t *          two phases to the animation (an `in` and an `out` phase) &#42;/\n\t *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * We also **must** include animations for the views that are being entered and removed\n\t * (otherwise anchoring wouldn't be possible since the new view would be inserted right away).\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * .view-animation.ng-enter, .view-animation.ng-leave {\n\t *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n\t *   position:fixed;\n\t *   left:0;\n\t *   top:0;\n\t *   width:100%;\n\t * }\n\t * .view-animation.ng-enter {\n\t *   transform:translateX(100%);\n\t * }\n\t * .view-animation.ng-leave,\n\t * .view-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n\t *   transform:translateX(0%);\n\t * }\n\t * .view-animation.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {\n\t *   transform:translateX(-100%);\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Now we can jump back to the anchor animation. When the animation happens, there are two stages that occur:\n\t * an `out` and an `in` stage. The `out` stage happens first and that is when the element is animated away\n\t * from its origin. Once that animation is over then the `in` stage occurs which animates the\n\t * element to its destination. The reason why there are two animations is to give enough time\n\t * for the enter animation on the new element to be ready.\n\t *\n\t * The example above sets up a transition for both the in and out phases, but we can also target the out or\n\t * in phases directly via `ng-anchor-out` and `ng-anchor-in`.\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * .banner.ng-anchor-out {\n\t *   transition: 0.5s linear all;\n\t *\n\t *   /&#42; the scale will be applied during the out animation,\n\t *          but will be animated away when the in animation runs &#42;/\n\t *   transform: scale(1.2);\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * .banner.ng-anchor-in {\n\t *   transition: 1s linear all;\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t *\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ### Anchoring Demo\n\t *\n\t  <example module=\"anchoringExample\"\n\t           name=\"anchoringExample\"\n\t           id=\"anchoringExample\"\n\t           deps=\"angular-animate.js;angular-route.js\"\n\t           animations=\"true\">\n\t    <file name=\"index.html\">\n\t      <a href=\"#/\">Home</a>\n\t      <hr />\n\t      <div class=\"view-container\">\n\t        <div ng-view class=\"view\"></div>\n\t      </div>\n\t    </file>\n\t    <file name=\"script.js\">\n\t      angular.module('anchoringExample', ['ngAnimate', 'ngRoute'])\n\t        .config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {\n\t          $routeProvider.when('/', {\n\t            templateUrl: 'home.html',\n\t            controller: 'HomeController as home'\n\t          });\n\t          $routeProvider.when('/profile/:id', {\n\t            templateUrl: 'profile.html',\n\t            controller: 'ProfileController as profile'\n\t          });\n\t        }])\n\t        .run(['$rootScope', function($rootScope) {\n\t          $rootScope.records = [\n\t            { id:1, title: \"Miss Beulah Roob\" },\n\t            { id:2, title: \"Trent Morissette\" },\n\t            { id:3, title: \"Miss Ava Pouros\" },\n\t            { id:4, title: \"Rod Pouros\" },\n\t            { id:5, title: \"Abdul Rice\" },\n\t            { id:6, title: \"Laurie Rutherford Sr.\" },\n\t            { id:7, title: \"Nakia McLaughlin\" },\n\t            { id:8, title: \"Jordon Blanda DVM\" },\n\t            { id:9, title: \"Rhoda Hand\" },\n\t            { id:10, title: \"Alexandrea Sauer\" }\n\t          ];\n\t        }])\n\t        .controller('HomeController', [function() {\n\t          //empty\n\t        }])\n\t        .controller('ProfileController', ['$rootScope', '$routeParams', function($rootScope, $routeParams) {\n\t          var index = parseInt($routeParams.id, 10);\n\t          var record = $rootScope.records[index - 1];\n\t\n\t          this.title = record.title;\n\t          this.id = record.id;\n\t        }]);\n\t    </file>\n\t    <file name=\"home.html\">\n\t      <h2>Welcome to the home page</h1>\n\t      <p>Please click on an element</p>\n\t      <a class=\"record\"\n\t         ng-href=\"#/profile/{{ record.id }}\"\n\t         ng-animate-ref=\"{{ record.id }}\"\n\t         ng-repeat=\"record in records\">\n\t        {{ record.title }}\n\t      </a>\n\t    </file>\n\t    <file name=\"profile.html\">\n\t      <div class=\"profile record\" ng-animate-ref=\"{{ profile.id }}\">\n\t        {{ profile.title }}\n\t      </div>\n\t    </file>\n\t    <file name=\"animations.css\">\n\t      .record {\n\t        display:block;\n\t        font-size:20px;\n\t      }\n\t      .profile {\n\t        background:black;\n\t        color:white;\n\t        font-size:100px;\n\t      }\n\t      .view-container {\n\t        position:relative;\n\t      }\n\t      .view-container > .view.ng-animate {\n\t        position:absolute;\n\t        top:0;\n\t        left:0;\n\t        width:100%;\n\t        min-height:500px;\n\t      }\n\t      .view.ng-enter, .view.ng-leave,\n\t      .record.ng-anchor {\n\t        transition:0.5s linear all;\n\t      }\n\t      .view.ng-enter {\n\t        transform:translateX(100%);\n\t      }\n\t      .view.ng-enter.ng-enter-active, .view.ng-leave {\n\t        transform:translateX(0%);\n\t      }\n\t      .view.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {\n\t        transform:translateX(-100%);\n\t      }\n\t      .record.ng-anchor-out {\n\t        background:red;\n\t      }\n\t    </file>\n\t  </example>\n\t *\n\t * ### How is the element transported?\n\t *\n\t * When an anchor animation occurs, ngAnimate will clone the starting element and position it exactly where the starting\n\t * element is located on screen via absolute positioning. The cloned element will be placed inside of the root element\n\t * of the application (where ng-app was defined) and all of the CSS classes of the starting element will be applied. The\n\t * element will then animate into the `out` and `in` animations and will eventually reach the coordinates and match\n\t * the dimensions of the destination element. During the entire animation a CSS class of `.ng-animate-shim` will be applied\n\t * to both the starting and destination elements in order to hide them from being visible (the CSS styling for the class\n\t * is: `visibility:hidden`). Once the anchor reaches its destination then it will be removed and the destination element\n\t * will become visible since the shim class will be removed.\n\t *\n\t * ### How is the morphing handled?\n\t *\n\t * CSS Anchoring relies on transitions and keyframes and the internal code is intelligent enough to figure out\n\t * what CSS classes differ between the starting element and the destination element. These different CSS classes\n\t * will be added/removed on the anchor element and a transition will be applied (the transition that is provided\n\t * in the anchor class). Long story short, ngAnimate will figure out what classes to add and remove which will\n\t * make the transition of the element as smooth and automatic as possible. Be sure to use simple CSS classes that\n\t * do not rely on DOM nesting structure so that the anchor element appears the same as the starting element (since\n\t * the cloned element is placed inside of root element which is likely close to the body element).\n\t *\n\t * Note that if the root element is on the `<html>` element then the cloned node will be placed inside of body.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ## Using $animate in your directive code\n\t *\n\t * So far we've explored how to feed in animations into an Angular application, but how do we trigger animations within our own directives in our application?\n\t * By injecting the `$animate` service into our directive code, we can trigger structural and class-based hooks which can then be consumed by animations. Let's\n\t * imagine we have a greeting box that shows and hides itself when the data changes\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <greeting-box active=\"onOrOff\">Hi there</greeting-box>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * ngModule.directive('greetingBox', ['$animate', function($animate) {\n\t *   return function(scope, element, attrs) {\n\t *     attrs.$observe('active', function(value) {\n\t *       value ? $animate.addClass(element, 'on') : $animate.removeClass(element, 'on');\n\t *     });\n\t *   });\n\t * }]);\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Now the `on` CSS class is added and removed on the greeting box component. Now if we add a CSS class on top of the greeting box element\n\t * in our HTML code then we can trigger a CSS or JS animation to happen.\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * /&#42; normally we would create a CSS class to reference on the element &#42;/\n\t * greeting-box.on { transition:0.5s linear all; background:green; color:white; }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * The `$animate` service contains a variety of other methods like `enter`, `leave`, `animate` and `setClass`. To learn more about what's\n\t * possible be sure to visit the {@link ng.$animate $animate service API page}.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ### Preventing Collisions With Third Party Libraries\n\t *\n\t * Some third-party frameworks place animation duration defaults across many element or className\n\t * selectors in order to make their code small and reuseable. This can lead to issues with ngAnimate, which\n\t * is expecting actual animations on these elements and has to wait for their completion.\n\t *\n\t * You can prevent this unwanted behavior by using a prefix on all your animation classes:\n\t *\n\t * ```css\n\t * /&#42; prefixed with animate- &#42;/\n\t * .animate-fade-add.animate-fade-add-active {\n\t *   transition:1s linear all;\n\t *   opacity:0;\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * You then configure `$animate` to enforce this prefix:\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * $animateProvider.classNameFilter(/animate-/);\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * This also may provide your application with a speed boost since only specific elements containing CSS class prefix\n\t * will be evaluated for animation when any DOM changes occur in the application.\n\t *\n\t * ## Callbacks and Promises\n\t *\n\t * When `$animate` is called it returns a promise that can be used to capture when the animation has ended. Therefore if we were to trigger\n\t * an animation (within our directive code) then we can continue performing directive and scope related activities after the animation has\n\t * ended by chaining onto the returned promise that animation method returns.\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * // somewhere within the depths of the directive\n\t * $animate.enter(element, parent).then(function() {\n\t *   //the animation has completed\n\t * });\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * (Note that earlier versions of Angular prior to v1.4 required the promise code to be wrapped using `$scope.$apply(...)`. This is not the case\n\t * anymore.)\n\t *\n\t * In addition to the animation promise, we can also make use of animation-related callbacks within our directives and controller code by registering\n\t * an event listener using the `$animate` service. Let's say for example that an animation was triggered on our view\n\t * routing controller to hook into that:\n\t *\n\t * ```js\n\t * ngModule.controller('HomePageController', ['$animate', function($animate) {\n\t *   $animate.on('enter', ngViewElement, function(element) {\n\t *     // the animation for this route has completed\n\t *   }]);\n\t * }])\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * (Note that you will need to trigger a digest within the callback to get angular to notice any scope-related changes.)\n\t */\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * @ngdoc service\n\t * @name $animate\n\t * @kind object\n\t *\n\t * @description\n\t * The ngAnimate `$animate` service documentation is the same for the core `$animate` service.\n\t *\n\t * Click here {@link ng.$animate to learn more about animations with `$animate`}.\n\t */\n\tangular.module('ngAnimate', [])\n\t  .directive('ngAnimateChildren', $$AnimateChildrenDirective)\n\t  .factory('$$rAFScheduler', $$rAFSchedulerFactory)\n\t\n\t  .factory('$$AnimateRunner', $$AnimateRunnerFactory)\n\t  .factory('$$animateAsyncRun', $$AnimateAsyncRunFactory)\n\t\n\t  .provider('$$animateQueue', $$AnimateQueueProvider)\n\t  .provider('$$animation', $$AnimationProvider)\n\t\n\t  .provider('$animateCss', $AnimateCssProvider)\n\t  .provider('$$animateCssDriver', $$AnimateCssDriverProvider)\n\t\n\t  .provider('$$animateJs', $$AnimateJsProvider)\n\t  .provider('$$animateJsDriver', $$AnimateJsDriverProvider);\n\t\n\t\n\t})(window, window.angular);\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 22 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t__webpack_require__(23);\n\tmodule.exports = 'ngRoute';\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 23 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\t/**\n\t * @license AngularJS v1.4.8\n\t * (c) 2010-2015 Google, Inc. http://angularjs.org\n\t * License: MIT\n\t */\n\t(function(window, angular, undefined) {'use strict';\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * @ngdoc module\n\t * @name ngRoute\n\t * @description\n\t *\n\t * # ngRoute\n\t *\n\t * The `ngRoute` module provides routing and deeplinking services and directives for angular apps.\n\t *\n\t * ## Example\n\t * See {@link ngRoute.$route#example $route} for an example of configuring and using `ngRoute`.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * <div doc-module-components=\"ngRoute\"></div>\n\t */\n\t /* global -ngRouteModule */\n\tvar ngRouteModule = angular.module('ngRoute', ['ng']).\n\t                        provider('$route', $RouteProvider),\n\t    $routeMinErr = angular.$$minErr('ngRoute');\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * @ngdoc provider\n\t * @name $routeProvider\n\t *\n\t * @description\n\t *\n\t * Used for configuring routes.\n\t *\n\t * ## Example\n\t * See {@link ngRoute.$route#example $route} for an example of configuring and using `ngRoute`.\n\t *\n\t * ## Dependencies\n\t * Requires the {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`} module to be installed.\n\t */\n\tfunction $RouteProvider() {\n\t  function inherit(parent, extra) {\n\t    return angular.extend(Object.create(parent), extra);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  var routes = {};\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * @ngdoc method\n\t   * @name $routeProvider#when\n\t   *\n\t   * @param {string} path Route path (matched against `$location.path`).

{@link ng.$location#search `search()`} and {@link ng.$location#path `path()`}.\n\t * The `path` parameters are extracted when the {@link ngRoute.$route `$route`} path is matched.\n\t *\n\t * In case of parameter name collision, `path` params take precedence over `search` params.\n\t *\n\t * The service guarantees that the identity of the `$routeParams` object will remain unchanged\n\t * (but its properties will likely change) even when a route change occurs.\n\t *\n\t * Note that the `$routeParams` are only updated *after* a route change completes successfully.\n\t * This means that you cannot rely on `$routeParams` being correct in route resolve functions.\n\t * Instead you can use `$route.current.params` to access the new route's parameters.\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * ```js\n\t *  // Given:\n\t *  // URL: http://server.com/index.html#/Chapter/1/Section/2?search=moby\n\t *  // Route: /Chapter/:chapterId/Section/:sectionId\n\t *  //\n\t *  // Then\n\t *  $routeParams ==>

Overview\n\t * `ngView` is a directive that complements the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service by\n\t * including the rendered template of the current route into the main layout (`index.html`) file.\n\t * Every time the current route changes, the included view changes with it according to the\n\t * configuration of the `$route` service.\n\t *\n\t * Requires the {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`}

enter and leave animation occur concurrently.\n\t *\n\t * @scope\n\t * @priority 400\n\t * @param {string=} onload Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.\n\t *\n\t * @param {string=} autoscroll Whether `ngView` should call {@link ng.$anchorScroll\n\t *                  $anchorScroll} to scroll the viewport after the view is updated.\n\t *\n\t *                  - If the attribute is not set, disable scrolling.\n\t *                  - If the attribute is set without value, enable scrolling.\n\t *                  - Otherwise enable scrolling only if the `autoscroll` attribute

The purpose of `$animateCss` is NOT\n * to side-step how `$animate` and ngAnimate work, but the goal is to allow pre-existing animations or\n * directives to create more complex animations that can be purely driven using CSS code.\n *\n * Note that only browsers that support CSS transitions and/or keyframe animations are capable of\n * rendering animations triggered via `$animateCss` (bad news for IE9 and lower).\n *\n * ## Usage\n * Once again, `$animateCss` is designed to be used inside of a registered JavaScript animation that\n * is powered by ngAnimate. It is possible to use `$animateCss` directly inside of a directive, however,\n * any automatic control over cancelling animations and/or preventing animations from being run on\n * child elements will not be handled by Angular. For this to work as expected, please use `$animate` to\n * trigger the animation and then setup a JavaScript animation that injects `$animateCss` to trigger\n * the CSS animation.\n *\n * The example below shows how we can create a folding animation on an element using `ng-if`:\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- notice the `fold-animation` CSS class -->\n * <div ng-if=\"onOff\" class=\"fold-animation\">\n *   This element will go BOOM\n * </div>\n * <button ng-click=\"onOff=true\">Fold In</button>\n * ```\n *\n * Now we create the **JavaScript animation** that will trigger the CSS transition:\n *\n * ```js\n * ngModule.animation('.fold-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {\n *   return {\n *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {\n *       var height = element[0].offsetHeight;\n *       return $animateCss(element, {\n *         from: { height:'0px' },\n *         to: { height:height + 'px' },\n *         duration: 1 // one second\n *       });\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * ## More Advanced Uses\n *\n * `$animateCss` is the underlying code that ngAnimate uses to power **CSS-based animations** behind the scenes. Therefore CSS hooks\n * like `.ng-EVENT`, `.ng-EVENT-active`, `.ng-EVENT-stagger` are all features that can be triggered using `$animateCss` via JavaScript code.\n *\n * This also means that just about any combination of adding classes, removing classes, setting styles, dynamically setting a keyframe animation,\n * applying a hardcoded duration or delay value, changing the animation easing or applying a stagger animation are all options that work with\n * `$animateCss`. The service itself is smart enough to figure out the combination of options and examine the element styling properties in order\n * to provide a working animation that will run in CSS.\n *\n * The example below showcases a more advanced version of the `.fold-animation` from the example above:\n *\n * ```js\n * ngModule.animation('.fold-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {\n *   return {\n *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {\n *       var height = element[0].offsetHeight;\n *       return $animateCss(element, {\n *         addClass: 'red large-text pulse-twice',\n *         easing: 'ease-out',\n *         from: { height:'0px' },\n *         to: { height:height + 'px' },\n *         duration: 1 // one second\n *       });\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * Since we're adding/removing CSS classes then the CSS transition will also pick those up:\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; since a hardcoded duration value of 1 was provided in the JavaScript animation code,\n * the CSS classes below will be transitioned despite them being defined as regular CSS classes &#42;/\n * .red { background:red; }\n * .large-text { font-size:20px; }\n *\n * /&#42; we can also use a keyframe animation and $animateCss will make it work alongside the transition &#42;/\n * .pulse-twice {\n *   animation: 0.5s pulse linear 2;\n *   -webkit-animation: 0.5s pulse linear 2;\n * }\n *\n * @keyframes pulse {\n *   from { transform: scale(0.5); }\n *   to { transform: scale(1.5); }\n * }\n *\n * @-webkit-keyframes pulse {\n *   from { -webkit-transform: scale(0.5); }\n *   to { -webkit-transform: scale(1.5); }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Given this complex combination of CSS classes, styles and options, `$animateCss` will figure everything out and make the animation happen.\n *\n * ## How the Options are handled\n *\n * `$animateCss` is very versatile and intelligent when it comes to figuring out what configurations to apply to the element to ensure the animation\n * works with the options provided. Say for example we were adding a class that contained a keyframe value and we wanted to also animate some inline\n * styles using the `from` and `to` properties.\n *\n * ```js\n * var animator = $animateCss(element, {\n *   from: { background:'red' },\n *   to: { background:'blue' }\n * });\n * animator.start();\n * ```\n *\n * ```css\n * .rotating-animation {\n *   animation:0.5s rotate linear;\n *   -webkit-animation:0.5s rotate linear;\n * }\n *\n * @keyframes rotate {\n *   from { transform: rotate(0deg); }\n *   to { transform: rotate(360deg); }\n * }\n *\n * @-webkit-keyframes rotate {\n *   from { -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg); }\n *   to { -webkit-transform: rotate(360deg); }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The missing pieces here are that we do not have a transition set (within the CSS code nor within the `$animateCss` options) and the duration of the animation is\n * going to be detected from what the keyframe styles on the CSS class are. In this event, `$animateCss` will automatically create an inline transition\n * style matching the duration detected from the keyframe style (which is present in the CSS class that is being added) and then prepare both the transition\n * and keyframe animations to run in parallel on the element. Then when the animation is underway the provided `from` and `to` CSS styles will be applied\n * and spread across the transition and keyframe animation.\n *\n * ## What is returned\n *\n * `$animateCss` works in two stages: a preparation phase and an animation phase. Therefore when `$animateCss` is first called it will NOT actually\n * start the animation. All that is going on here is that the element is being prepared for the animation (which means that the generated CSS classes are\n * added and removed on the element). Once `$animateCss` is called it will return an object with the following properties:\n *\n * ```js\n * var animator = $animateCss(element, { ... });\n * ```\n *\n * Now what do the contents of our `animator` variable look like:\n *\n * ```js\n * {\n *   // starts the animation\n *   start: Function,\n *\n *   // ends (aborts) the animation\n *   end: Function\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * To actually start the animation we need to run `animation.start()` which will then return a promise that we can hook into to detect when the animation ends.\n * If we choose not to run the animation then we MUST run `animation.end()` to perform a cleanup on the element (since some CSS classes and stlyes may have been\n * applied to the element during the preparation phase). Note that all other properties such as duration, delay, transitions and keyframes are just properties\n * and that changing them will not reconfigure the parameters of the animation.\n *\n * ### runner.done() vs runner.then()\n * It is documented that `animation.start()` will return a promise object and this is true, however, there is also an additional method available on the\n * runner called `.done(callbackFn)`. The done method works the same as `.finally(callbackFn)`, however, it does **not trigger a digest to occur**.\n * Therefore, for performance reasons, it's always best to use `runner.done(callback)` instead of `runner.then()`, `runner.catch()` or `runner.finally()`\n * unless you really need a digest to kick off afterwards.\n *\n * Keep in mind that, to make this easier, ngAnimate has tweaked the JS animations API to recognize when a runner instance is returned from $animateCss\n * (so there is no need to call `runner.done(doneFn)` inside of your JavaScript animation code).\n * Check the {@link ngAnimate.$animateCss#usage animation code above} to see how this works.\n *\n * @param {DOMElement} element the element that will be animated\n * @param {object} options the animation-related options that will be applied during the animation\n *\n * * `event` - The DOM event (e.g. enter, leave, move). When used, a generated CSS class of `ng-EVENT` and `ng-EVENT-active` will be applied\n * to the element during the animation. Multiple events can be provided when spaces are used as a separator. (Note that this will not perform any DOM operation.)\n * * `structural` - Indicates that the `ng-` prefix will be added to the event class. Setting to `false` or omitting will turn `ng-EVENT` and\n * `ng-EVENT-active` in `EVENT` and `EVENT-active`. Unused if `event` is omitted.\n * * `easing` - The CSS easing value that will be applied to the transition or keyframe animation (or both).\n * * `transitionStyle` - The raw CSS transition style that will be used (e.g. `1s linear all`).\n * * `keyframeStyle` - The raw CSS keyframe animation style that will be used (e.g. `1s my_animation linear`).\n * * `from` - The starting CSS styles (a key/value object) that will be applied at the start of the animation.\n * * `to` - The ending CSS styles (a key/value object) that will be applied across the animation via a CSS transition.\n * * `addClass` - A space separated list of CSS classes that will be added to the element and spread across the animation.\n * * `removeClass` - A space separated list of CSS classes that will be removed from the element and spread across the animation.\n * * `duration` - A number value representing the total duration of the transition and/or keyframe (note that a value of 1 is 1000ms). If a value of `0`\n * is provided then the animation will be skipped entirely.\n * * `delay` - A number value representing the total delay of the transition and/or keyframe (note that a value of 1 is 1000ms). If a value of `true` is\n * used then whatever delay value is detected from the CSS classes will be mirrored on the elements styles (e.g. by setting delay true then the style value\n * of the element will be `transition-delay: DETECTED_VALUE`). Using `true` is useful when you want the CSS classes and inline styles to all share the same\n * CSS delay value.\n * * `stagger` - A numeric time value representing the delay between successively animated elements\n * ({@link ngAnimate#css-staggering-animations Click here to learn how CSS-based staggering works in ngAnimate.})\n * * `staggerIndex` - The numeric index representing the stagger item (e.g. a value of 5 is equal to the sixth item in the stagger; therefore when a\n * * `stagger` option value of `0.1` is used then there will be a stagger delay of `600ms`)\n * * `applyClassesEarly` - Whether or not the classes being added or removed will be used when detecting the animation. This is set by `$animate` when enter/leave/move animations are fired to ensure that the CSS classes are resolved in time. (Note that this will prevent any transitions from occuring on the classes being added and removed.)\n * * `cleanupStyles` - Whether or not the provided `from` and `to` styles will be removed once\n *    the animation is closed. This is useful for when the styles are used purely for the sake of\n *    the animation and do not have a lasting visual effect on the element (e.g. a colapse and open animation).\n *    By default this value is set to `false`.\n *\n * @return {object} an object with start and end methods and details about the animation.\n *\n * * `start` - The method to start the animation. This will return a `Promise` when called.\n * * `end` - This method will cancel the animation and remove all applied CSS classes and styles.\n */\nvar ONE_SECOND = 1000;\nvar BASE_TEN = 10;\n\nvar ELAPSED_TIME_MAX_DECIMAL_PLACES = 3;\nvar CLOSING_TIME_BUFFER = 1.5;\n\nvar DETECT_CSS_PROPERTIES = {\n  transitionDuration:      TRANSITION_DURATION_PROP,\n  transitionDelay:         TRANSITION_DELAY_PROP,\n  transitionProperty:      TRANSITION_PROP + PROPERTY_KEY,\n  animationDuration:       ANIMATION_DURATION_PROP,\n  animationDelay:          ANIMATION_DELAY_PROP,\n  animationIterationCount: ANIMATION_PROP + ANIMATION_ITERATION_COUNT_KEY\n};\n\nvar DETECT_STAGGER_CSS_PROPERTIES = {\n  transitionDuration:      TRANSITION_DURATION_PROP,\n  transitionDelay:         TRANSITION_DELAY_PROP,\n  animationDuration:       ANIMATION_DURATION_PROP,\n  animationDelay:          ANIMATION_DELAY_PROP\n};\n\nfunction getCssKeyframeDurationStyle(duration) {\n  return [ANIMATION_DURATION_PROP, duration + 's'];\n}\n\nfunction getCssDelayStyle(delay, isKeyframeAnimation) {\n  var prop = isKeyframeAnimation ?

Animations are not enabled by default, however, by including `ngAnimate` the animation hooks are enabled for an Angular app.\n *\n * <div doc-module-components=\"ngAnimate\"></div>\n *\n * # Usage\n * Simply put, there are two ways to make use of animations when ngAnimate is used: by using **CSS** and **JavaScript**. The former works purely based\n * using CSS (by using matching CSS selectors/styles) and the latter triggers animations that are registered via `module.animation()`. For\n * both CSS and JS animations the sole requirement is to have a matching `CSS class` that exists both in the registered animation and within\n * the HTML element that the animation will be triggered on.\n *\n * ## Directive Support\n * The following directives are \"animation aware\":\n *\n * | Directive                                                                                                | Supported Animations                                                     |\n * |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#animations ngRepeat}                                                        | enter, leave and move                                                    |\n * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#animations ngView}                                                       | enter and leave                                                          |\n * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#animations ngInclude}                                                      | enter and leave                                                          |\n * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#animations ngSwitch}                                                        | enter and leave                                                          |\n * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#animations ngIf}                                                                | enter and leave                                                          |\n * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#animations ngClass}                                                          | add and remove (the CSS class(es) present)                               |\n * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#animations ngShow} & {@link ng.directive:ngHide#animations ngHide}            | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)                                 |\n * | {@link ng.directive:form#animation-hooks form} & {@link ng.directive:ngModel#animation-hooks ngModel}    | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations) |\n * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessages}                                                          | add and remove (ng-active & ng-inactive)                                 |\n * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessage}                                                           | enter and leave                                                          |\n *\n * (More information can be found by visiting each the documentation associated with each directive.)\n *\n * ## CSS-based Animations\n *\n * CSS-based animations with ngAnimate are unique since they require no JavaScript code at all. By using a CSS class that we reference between our HTML\n * and CSS code we can create an animation that will be picked up by Angular when an the underlying directive performs an operation.\n *\n * The example below shows how an `enter` animation can be made possible on an element using `ng-if`:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-if=\"bool\" class=\"fade\">\n *    Fade me in out\n * </div>\n * <button ng-click=\"bool=true\">Fade In!</button>\n * <button ng-click=\"bool=false\">Fade Out!</button>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice the CSS class **fade**? We can now create the CSS transition code that references this class:\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; The starting CSS styles for the enter animation &#42;/\n * .fade.ng-enter {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n *\n * /&#42; The finishing CSS styles for the enter animation &#42;/\n * .fade.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n *   opacity:1;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The key thing to remember here is that, depending on the animation event (which each of the directives above trigger depending on what's going on) two\n * generated CSS classes will be applied to the element; in the example above we have `.ng-enter` and `.ng-enter-active`. For CSS transitions, the transition\n * code **must** be defined within the starting CSS class (in this case `.ng-enter`). The destination class is what the transition will animate towards.\n *\n * If for example we wanted to create animations for `leave` and `move` (ngRepeat triggers move) then we can do so using the same CSS naming conventions:\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; now the element will fade out before it is removed from the DOM &#42;/\n * .fade.ng-leave {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   opacity:1;\n * }\n * .fade.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We can also make use of **CSS Keyframes** by referencing the keyframe animation within the starting CSS class:\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; there is no need to define anything inside of the destination\n * CSS class since the keyframe will take charge of the animation &#42;/\n * .fade.ng-leave {\n *   animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;\n *   -webkit-animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;\n * }\n *\n * @keyframes my_fade_animation {\n *   from { opacity:1; }\n *   to { opacity:0; }\n * }\n *\n * @-webkit-keyframes my_fade_animation {\n *   from { opacity:1; }\n *   to { opacity:0; }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Feel free also mix transitions and keyframes together as well as any other CSS classes on the same element.\n *\n * ### CSS Class-based Animations\n *\n * Class-based animations (animations that are triggered via `ngClass`, `ngShow`, `ngHide` and some other directives) have a slightly different\n * naming convention. Class-based animations are basic enough that a standard transition or keyframe can be referenced on the class being added\n * and removed.\n *\n * For example if we wanted to do a CSS animation for `ngHide` then we place an animation on the `.ng-hide` CSS class:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-show=\"bool\" class=\"fade\">\n *   Show and hide me\n * </div>\n * <button ng-click=\"bool=true\">Toggle</button>\n *\n * <style>\n * .fade.ng-hide {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n * </style>\n * ```\n *\n * All that is going on here with ngShow/ngHide behind the scenes is the `.ng-hide` class is added/removed (when the hidden state is valid). Since\n * ngShow and ngHide are animation aware then we can match up a transition and ngAnimate handles the rest.\n *\n * In addition the addition and removal of the CSS class, ngAnimate also provides two helper methods that we can use to further decorate the animation\n * with CSS styles.\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-class=\"{on:onOff}\" class=\"highlight\">\n *   Highlight this box\n * </div>\n * <button ng-click=\"onOff=!onOff\">Toggle</button>\n *\n * <style>\n * .highlight {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n * }\n * .highlight.on-add {\n *   background:white;\n * }\n * .highlight.on {\n *   background:yellow;\n * }\n * .highlight.on-remove {\n *   background:black;\n * }\n * </style>\n * ```\n *\n * We can also make use of CSS keyframes by placing them within the CSS classes.\n *\n *\n * ### CSS Staggering Animations\n * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a\n * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module (versions >=1.2) supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be\n * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for\n * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an\n * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).\n *\n * ```css\n * .my-animation.ng-enter {\n *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/\n *   transition: 1s linear all;\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {\n *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/\n *   transition-delay: 0.1s;\n *\n *   /&#42; As of 1.4.4, this must always be set: it signals ngAnimate\n *     to not accidentally inherit a delay property from another CSS class &#42;/\n *   transition-duration: 0s;\n * }\n * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/\n *   opacity:1;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations\n * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this\n * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation\n * will also be reset if one or more animation frames have passed since the multiple calls to `$animate` were fired.\n *\n * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:\n *\n * ```js\n * var kids = parent.children();\n *\n * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0\n * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1\n * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2\n * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3\n * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4\n *\n * window.requestAnimationFrame(function() {\n *   //stagger has reset itself\n *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0\n *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1\n *\n *   $scope.$digest();\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.\n *\n * ### The `ng-animate` CSS class\n *\n * When ngAnimate is animating an element it will apply the `ng-animate` CSS class to the element for the duration of the animation.\n * This is a temporary CSS class and it will be removed once the animation is over (for both JavaScript and CSS-based animations).\n *\n * Therefore, animations can be applied to an element using this temporary class directly via CSS.\n *\n * ```css\n * .zipper.ng-animate {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n * }\n * .zipper.ng-enter {\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n * .zipper.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n *   opacity:1;\n * }\n * .zipper.ng-leave {\n *   opacity:1;\n * }\n * .zipper.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * (Note that the `ng-animate` CSS class is reserved and it cannot be applied on an element directly since ngAnimate will always remove\n * the CSS class once an animation has completed.)\n *\n *\n * ## JavaScript-based Animations\n *\n * ngAnimate also allows for animations to be consumed by JavaScript code. The approach is similar to CSS-based animations (where there is a shared\n * CSS class that is referenced in our HTML code) but in addition we need to register the JavaScript animation on the module. By making use of the\n * `module.animation()` module function we can register the ainmation.\n *\n * Let's see an example of a enter/leave animation using `ngRepeat`:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-repeat=\"item in items\" class=\"slide\">\n *   {{ item }}\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * See the **slide** CSS class? Let's use that class to define an animation that we'll structure in our module code by using `module.animation`:\n *\n * ```js\n * myModule.animation('.slide', [function() {\n *   return {\n *     // make note that other events (like addClass/removeClass)\n *     // have different function input parameters\n *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {\n *       jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);\n *\n *       // remember to call doneFn so that angular\n *       // knows that the animation has concluded\n *     },\n *\n *     move: function(element, doneFn) {\n *       jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);\n *     },\n *\n *     leave: function(element, doneFn) {\n *       jQuery(element).fadeOut(1000, doneFn);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * The nice thing about JS-based animations is that we can inject other services and make use of advanced animation libraries such as\n * greensock.js and velocity.js.\n *\n * If our animation code class-based (meaning that something like `ngClass`, `ngHide` and `ngShow` triggers it) then we can still define\n * our animations inside of the same registered animation, however, the function input arguments are a bit different:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-class=\"color\" class=\"colorful\">\n *   this box is moody\n * </div>\n * <button ng-click=\"color='red'\">Change to red</button>\n * <button ng-click=\"color='blue'\">Change to blue</button>\n * <button ng-click=\"color='green'\">Change to green</button>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * myModule.animation('.colorful', [function() {\n *   return {\n *     addClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {\n *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn\n *     },\n *     removeClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {\n *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn\n *     },\n *     setClass: function(element, addedClass, removedClass, doneFn) {\n *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * ## CSS + JS Animations Together\n *\n * AngularJS 1.4 and higher has taken steps to make the amalgamation of CSS and JS animations more flexible. However, unlike earlier versions of Angular,\n * defining CSS and JS animations to work off of the same CSS class will not work anymore. Therefore the example below will only result in **JS animations taking\n * charge of the animation**:\n *\n * ```html\n * <div ng-if=\"bool\" class=\"slide\">\n *   Slide in and out\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * myModule.animation('.slide', [function() {\n *   return {\n *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {\n *       jQuery(element).slideIn(1000, doneFn);\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * ```css\n * .slide.ng-enter {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   transform:translateY(-100px);\n * }\n * .slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n *   transform:translateY(0);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Does this mean that CSS and JS animations cannot be used together? Do JS-based animations always have higher priority? We can make up for the\n * lack of CSS animations by using the `$animateCss` service to trigger our own tweaked-out, CSS-based animations directly from\n * our own JS-based animation code:\n *\n * ```js\n * myModule.animation('.slide', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {\n *   return {\n *     enter: function(element) {\n*        // this will trigger `.slide.ng-enter` and `.slide.ng-enter-active`.\n *       return $animateCss(element, {\n *         event: 'enter',\n *         structural: true\n *       });\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * The nice thing here is that we can save bandwidth by sticking to our CSS-based animation code and we don't need to rely on a 3rd-party animation framework.\n *\n * The `$animateCss` service is very powerful since we can feed in all kinds of extra properties that will be evaluated and fed into a CSS transition or\n * keyframe animation. For example if we wanted to animate the height of an element while adding and removing classes then we can do so by providing that\n * data into `$animateCss` directly:\n *\n * ```js\n * myModule.animation('.slide', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {\n *   return {\n *     enter: function(element) {\n *       return $animateCss(element, {\n *         event: 'enter',\n *         structural: true,\n *         addClass: 'maroon-setting',\n *         from: { height:0 },\n *         to: { height: 200 }\n *       });\n *     }\n *   }\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * Now we can fill in the rest via our transition CSS code:\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; the transition tells ngAnimate to make the animation happen &#42;/\n * .slide.ng-enter { transition:0.5s linear all; }\n *\n * /&#42; this extra CSS class will be absorbed into the transition\n * since the $animateCss code is adding the class &#42;/\n * .maroon-setting { background:red; }\n * ```\n *\n * And `$animateCss` will figure out the rest. Just make sure to have the `done()` callback fire the `doneFn` function to signal when the animation is over.\n *\n * To learn more about what's possible be sure to visit the {@link ngAnimate.$animateCss $animateCss service}.\n *\n * ## Animation Anchoring (via `ng-animate-ref`)\n *\n * ngAnimate in AngularJS 1.4 comes packed with the ability to cross-animate elements between\n * structural areas of an application (like views) by pairing up elements using an attribute\n * called `ng-animate-ref`.\n *\n * Let's say for example we have two views that are managed by `ng-view` and we want to show\n * that there is a relationship between two components situated in within these views. By using the\n * `ng-animate-ref` attribute we can identify that the two components are paired together and we\n * can then attach an animation, which is triggered when the view changes.\n *\n * Say for example we have the following template code:\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- index.html -->\n * <div ng-view class=\"view-animation\">\n * </div>\n *\n * <!-- home.html -->\n * <a href=\"#/banner-page\">\n *   <img src=\"./banner.jpg\" class=\"banner\" ng-animate-ref=\"banner\">\n * </a>\n *\n * <!-- banner-page.html -->\n * <img src=\"./banner.jpg\" class=\"banner\" ng-animate-ref=\"banner\">\n * ```\n *\n * Now, when the view changes (once the link is clicked), ngAnimate will examine the\n * HTML contents to see if there is a match reference between any components in the view\n * that is leaving and the view that is entering. It will scan both the view which is being\n * removed (leave) and inserted (enter) to see if there are any paired DOM elements that\n * contain a matching ref value.\n *\n * The two images match since they share the same ref value. ngAnimate will now create a\n * transport element (which is a clone of the first image element) and it will then attempt\n * to animate to the position of the second image element in the next view. For the animation to\n * work a special CSS class called `ng-anchor` will be added to the transported element.\n *\n * We can now attach a transition onto the `.banner.ng-anchor` CSS class and then\n * ngAnimate will handle the entire transition for us as well as the addition and removal of\n * any changes of CSS classes between the elements:\n *\n * ```css\n * .banner.ng-anchor {\n *   /&#42; this animation will last for 1 second since there are\n *          two phases to the animation (an `in` and an `out` phase) &#42;/\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * We also **must** include animations for the views that are being entered and removed\n * (otherwise anchoring wouldn't be possible since the new view would be inserted right away).\n *\n * ```css\n * .view-animation.ng-enter, .view-animation.ng-leave {\n *   transition:0.5s linear all;\n *   position:fixed;\n *   left:0;\n *   top:0;\n *   width:100%;\n * }\n * .view-animation.ng-enter {\n *   transform:translateX(100%);\n * }\n * .view-animation.ng-leave,\n * .view-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {\n *   transform:translateX(0%);\n * }\n * .view-animation.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {\n *   transform:translateX(-100%);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Now we can jump back to the anchor animation. When the animation happens, there are two stages that occur:\n * an `out` and an `in` stage. The `out` stage happens first and that is when the element is animated away\n * from its origin. Once that animation is over then the `in` stage occurs which animates the\n * element to its destination. The reason why there are two animations is to give enough time\n * for the enter animation on the new element to be ready.\n *\n * The example above sets up a transition for both the in and out phases, but we can also target the out or\n * in phases directly via `ng-anchor-out` and `ng-anchor-in`.\n *\n * ```css\n * .banner.ng-anchor-out {\n *   transition: 0.5s linear all;\n *\n *   /&#42; the scale will be applied during the out animation,\n *          but will be animated away when the in animation runs &#42;/\n *   transform: scale(1.2);\n * }\n *\n * .banner.ng-anchor-in {\n *   transition: 1s linear all;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *\n *\n *\n * ### Anchoring Demo\n *\n  <example module=\"anchoringExample\"\n           name=\"anchoringExample\"\n           id=\"anchoringExample\"\n           deps=\"angular-animate.js;angular-route.js\"\n           animations=\"true\">\n    <file name=\"index.html\">\n      <a href=\"#/\">Home</a>\n      <hr />\n      <div class=\"view-container\">\n        <div ng-view class=\"view\"></div>\n      </div>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"script.js\">\n      angular.module('anchoringExample', ['ngAnimate', 'ngRoute'])\n        .config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {\n          $routeProvider.when('/', {\n            templateUrl: 'home.html',\n            controller: 'HomeController as home'\n          });\n          $routeProvider.when('/profile/:id', {\n            templateUrl: 'profile.html',\n            controller: 'ProfileController as profile'\n          });\n        }])\n        .run(['$rootScope', function($rootScope) {\n          $rootScope.records = [\n            { id:1, title: \"Miss Beulah Roob\" },\n            { id:2, title: \"Trent Morissette\" },\n            { id:3, title: \"Miss Ava Pouros\" },\n            { id:4, title: \"Rod Pouros\" },\n            { id:5, title: \"Abdul Rice\" },\n            { id:6, title: \"Laurie Rutherford Sr.\" },\n            { id:7, title: \"Nakia McLaughlin\" },\n            { id:8, title: \"Jordon Blanda DVM\" },\n            { id:9, title: \"Rhoda Hand\" },\n            { id:10, title: \"Alexandrea Sauer\" }\n          ];\n        }])\n        .controller('HomeController', [function() {\n          //empty\n        }])\n        .controller('ProfileController', ['$rootScope', '$routeParams', function($rootScope, $routeParams) {\n          var index = parseInt($routeParams.id, 10);\n          var record = $rootScope.records[index - 1];\n\n          this.title = record.title;\n          this.id = record.id;\n        }]);\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"home.html\">\n      <h2>Welcome to the home page</h1>\n      <p>Please click on an element</p>\n      <a class=\"record\"\n         ng-href=\"#/profile/{{ record.id }}\"\n         ng-animate-ref=\"{{ record.id }}\"\n         ng-repeat=\"record in records\">\n        {{ record.title }}\n      </a>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"profile.html\">\n      <div class=\"profile record\" ng-animate-ref=\"{{ profile.id }}\">\n        {{ profile.title }}\n      </div>\n    </file>\n    <file name=\"animations.css\">\n      .record {\n        display:block;\n        font-size:20px;\n      }\n      .profile {\n        background:black;\n        color:white;\n        font-size:100px;\n      }\n      .view-container {\n        position:relative;\n      }\n      .view-container > .view.ng-animate {\n        position:absolute;\n        top:0;\n        left:0;\n        width:100%;\n        min-height:500px;\n      }\n      .view.ng-enter, .view.ng-leave,\n      .record.ng-anchor {\n        transition:0.5s linear all;\n      }\n      .view.ng-enter {\n        transform:translateX(100%);\n      }\n      .view.ng-enter.ng-enter-active, .view.ng-leave {\n        transform:translateX(0%);\n      }\n      .view.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {\n        transform:translateX(-100%);\n      }\n      .record.ng-anchor-out {\n        background:red;\n      }\n    </file>\n  </example>\n *\n * ### How is the element transported?\n *\n * When an anchor animation occurs, ngAnimate will clone the starting element and position it exactly where the starting\n * element is located on screen via absolute positioning. The cloned element will be placed inside of the root element\n * of the application (where ng-app was defined) and all of the CSS classes of the starting element will be applied. The\n * element will then animate into the `out` and `in` animations and will eventually reach the coordinates and match\n * the dimensions of the destination element. During the entire animation a CSS class of `.ng-animate-shim` will be applied\n * to both the starting and destination elements in order to hide them from being visible (the CSS styling for the class\n * is: `visibility:hidden`). Once the anchor reaches its destination then it will be removed and the destination element\n * will become visible since the shim class will be removed.\n *\n * ### How is the morphing handled?\n *\n * CSS Anchoring relies on transitions and keyframes and the internal code is intelligent enough to figure out\n * what CSS classes differ between the starting element and the destination element. These different CSS classes\n * will be added/removed on the anchor element and a transition will be applied (the transition that is provided\n * in the anchor class). Long story short, ngAnimate will figure out what classes to add and remove which will\n * make the transition of the element as smooth and automatic as possible. Be sure to use simple CSS classes that\n * do not rely on DOM nesting structure so that the anchor element appears the same as the starting element (since\n * the cloned element is placed inside of root element which is likely close to the body element).\n *\n * Note that if the root element is on the `<html>` element then the cloned node will be placed inside of body.\n *\n *\n * ## Using $animate in your directive code\n *\n * So far we've explored how to feed in animations into an Angular application, but how do we trigger animations within our own directives in our application?\n * By injecting the `$animate` service into our directive code, we can trigger structural and class-based hooks which can then be consumed by animations. Let's\n * imagine we have a greeting box that shows and hides itself when the data changes\n *\n * ```html\n * <greeting-box active=\"onOrOff\">Hi there</greeting-box>\n * ```\n *\n * ```js\n * ngModule.directive('greetingBox', ['$animate', function($animate) {\n *   return function(scope, element, attrs) {\n *     attrs.$observe('active', function(value) {\n *       value ? $animate.addClass(element, 'on') : $animate.removeClass(element, 'on');\n *     });\n *   });\n * }]);\n * ```\n *\n * Now the `on` CSS class is added and removed on the greeting box component. Now if we add a CSS class on top of the greeting box element\n * in our HTML code then we can trigger a CSS or JS animation to happen.\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; normally we would create a CSS class to reference on the element &#42;/\n * greeting-box.on { transition:0.5s linear all; background:green; color:white; }\n * ```\n *\n * The `$animate` service contains a variety of other methods like `enter`, `leave`, `animate` and `setClass`. To learn more about what's\n * possible be sure to visit the {@link ng.$animate $animate service API page}.\n *\n *\n * ### Preventing Collisions With Third Party Libraries\n *\n * Some third-party frameworks place animation duration defaults across many element or className\n * selectors in order to make their code small and reuseable. This can lead to issues with ngAnimate, which\n * is expecting actual animations on these elements and has to wait for their completion.\n *\n * You can prevent this unwanted behavior by using a prefix on all your animation classes:\n *\n * ```css\n * /&#42; prefixed with animate- &#42;/\n * .animate-fade-add.animate-fade-add-active {\n *   transition:1s linear all;\n *   opacity:0;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * You then configure `$animate` to enforce this prefix:\n *\n * ```js\n * $animateProvider.classNameFilter(/animate-/);\n * ```\n *\n * This also may provide your application with a speed boost since only specific elements containing CSS class prefix\n * will be evaluated for animation when any DOM changes occur in the application.\n *\n * ## Callbacks and Promises\n *\n * When `$animate` is called it returns a promise that can be used to capture when the animation has ended. Therefore if we were to trigger\n * an animation (within our directive code) then we can continue performing directive and scope related activities after the animation has\n * ended by chaining onto the returned promise that animation method returns.\n *\n * ```js\n * // somewhere within the depths of the directive\n * $animate.enter(element, parent).then(function() {\n *   //the animation has completed\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * (Note that earlier versions of Angular prior to v1.4 required the promise code to be wrapped using `$scope.$apply(...)`. This is not the case\n * anymore.)\n *\n * In addition to the animation promise, we can also make use of animation-related callbacks within our directives and controller code by registering\n * an event listener using the `$animate` service. Let's say for example that an animation was triggered on our view\n * routing controller to hook into that:\n *\n * ```js\n * ngModule.controller('HomePageController', ['$animate', function($animate) {\n *   $animate.on('enter', ngViewElement, function(element) {\n *     // the animation for this route has completed\n *   }]);\n * }])\n * ```\n *\n * (Note that you will need to trigger a digest within the callback to get angular to notice any scope-related changes.)\n */\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc service\n * @name $animate\n * @kind object\n *\n * @description\n * The ngAnimate `$animate` service documentation is the same for the core `$animate` service.\n *\n * Click here {@link ng.$animate to learn more about animations with `$animate`}.\n */\nangular.module('ngAnimate', [])\n  .directive('ngAnimateChildren', $$AnimateChildrenDirective)\n  .factory('$$rAFScheduler', $$rAFSchedulerFactory)\n\n  .factory('$$AnimateRunner', $$AnimateRunnerFactory)\n  .factory('$$animateAsyncRun', $$AnimateAsyncRunFactory)\n\n  .provider('$$animateQueue', $$AnimateQueueProvider)\n  .provider('$$animation', $$AnimationProvider)\n\n  .provider('$animateCss', $AnimateCssProvider)\n  .provider('$$animateCssDriver', $$AnimateCssDriverProvider)\n\n  .provider('$$animateJs', $$AnimateJsProvider)\n  .provider('$$animateJsDriver', $$AnimateJsDriverProvider);\n\n\n})(window, window.angular);\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/angular-animate/angular-animate.js\n ** module id = 21\n ** module chunks = 2\n **/","require('./angular-route');\nmodule.exports = 'ngRoute';\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/angular-route/index.js\n ** module id = 22\n ** module chunks = 2\n **/","/**\n * @license AngularJS v1.4.8\n * (c) 2010-2015 Google, Inc. http://angularjs.org\n * License: MIT\n */\n(function(window, angular, undefined) {'use strict';\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc module\n * @name ngRoute\n * @description\n *\n * # ngRoute\n *\n * The `ngRoute` module provides routing and deeplinking services and directives for angular apps.\n *\n * ## Example\n * See {@link ngRoute.$route#example $route} for an example of configuring and using `ngRoute`.\n *\n *\n * <div doc-module-components=\"ngRoute\"></div>\n */\n /* global -ngRouteModule */\nvar ngRouteModule = angular.module('ngRoute', ['ng']).\n                        provider('$route', $RouteProvider),\n    $routeMinErr = angular.$$minErr('ngRoute');\n\n/**\n * @ngdoc provider\n * @name $routeProvider\n *\n * @description\n *\n * Used for configuring routes.\n *\n * ## Example\n * See {@link ngRoute.$route#example $route} for an example of configuring and using `ngRoute`.\n *\n * ## Dependencies\n * Requires the {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`} module to be installed.\n */\nfunction $RouteProvider() {\n  function inherit(parent, extra) {\n    return angular.extend(Object.create(parent), extra);\n  }\n\n  var routes = {};\n\n  /**\n   * @ngdoc method\n   * @name $routeProvider#when\n   *\n   * @param {string} path Route path (matched against `$location.path`).
